/**
 * The UML class diagram in the documentation illustrates the overall payload
 * structure including both request and response objects. Payloads are rooted in
 * named objects; Openrtb as a common root and Request and Response as
 * subordinate roots to identify the payload type.
 *
 * Throughout the object model subsections, attributes may be indicated as
 * “Required” or “Recommended”. Attributes are deemed required only if their
 * omission would break the protocol and is not necessarily an indicator of
 * business value otherwise. Attributes are recommended when their omission
 * would not break the protocol but would dramatically diminish business value.
 *
 * From a specification compliance perspective, any attribute not denoted
 * required is optional, whether recommended or not. An optional attribute may
 * have a default value to be assumed if omitted. If no default is indicated,
 * then by convention its absence should be interpreted as unknown, unless
 * otherwise specified. Empty strings or null values should be interpreted the
 * same as omitted (i.e., the default if one is specified or unknown otherwise).
 *
 * BEST PRACTICE: Exchanges and demand sources are encouraged to publish to
 * their partners the set of optional objects and attributes they support along
 * with any extensions to the specification.
